# Data Table + Store

<b>This is not a maintained package.</b> Use production ready libraries like [Tanstack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest) if you want to quickly build a Data Table.

### Dissatisfied wih the current options for datatables, Leah set out to build her own performant and extensible Table.

The store is implemented in pure TS and the table is pure React (not testetd for server components). To render all features of the table quite a few custom components are needed. See the mantine implementation if you want to build your own.
